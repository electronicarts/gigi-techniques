    "Description":"I wrote a 1D/2D FFT-1024 utilizing groupshared and waveintrinsics. I also wrote a 2D FFT-4096, but the VGPR usage is too high to get good occupancy with it - I still have some ideas about how to fix this, but it'll take some work. This was my first time writing & optimizing compute shaders, but gigi made it easy. My 1024x1024 FFT-based convolution [show here with a gaussian blur] runs in 0.43ms on my 3080",
