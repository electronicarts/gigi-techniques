    "Description":"The chaos game is a way to make fractals through a random walk. You start with vertices and initialize a cursor to a random vertex. From there, you pick a vertex at random again and move towards that vertex some percentage amount and plot a point. Repeat many many times and you'll get a fractal. Using different numbers of points in different configurations with different percentage movements results in different fractals. This is the chaos game in 3d and has a checkbox to turn on red/blue 3d glasses mode.",
